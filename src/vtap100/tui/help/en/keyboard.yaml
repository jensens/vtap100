  title: Keyboard Emulation
  description: |
    Keyboard emulation sends pass data as keystrokes
    to the connected computer. Successful pass reads
    appear in any open text editor.

  log_mode:
    title: Enable Keyboard (KBLogMode)
    description: |
      Enables keyboard emulation.
      When enabled, pass data is sent as keystrokes.
    tip: |
      Useful for simple integrations without software development.
      Works with any program that accepts keyboard input.

  source:
    title: Data Sources (KBSource)
    description: |
      Defines which data types trigger keyboard output.
      Hexadecimal bitmask combining multiple sources.
    format: |
      0x80 = Mobile Pass (Apple VAS / Google Smart Tap)
      0x40 = STUID
      0x20 = Card Emulation Write Mode
      0x04 = Scanners
      0x02 = Command Interface
      0x01 = Card/Tag UID
    example: "A5 (Mobile + Emulation + Scanners + UID)"
    tip: |
      Common values:
      A5 = Default (Mobile + Emulation + Scanners + UID)
      81 = Mobile Pass + Card/Tag UID
      80 = Mobile Pass only
      01 = Card/Tag UID only

  prefix:
    title: Prefix (KBPrefix)
    description: |
      Optional text before pass data.
      Can contain ASCII-hex (%0A) or variables ($t).
    format: |
      %XX = ASCII-hex (e.g. %0A for newline)
      $t = Timestamp
      $d = Date
      $n = Sequence number
    example: "$t|"
    tip: Leave empty if no prefix is needed.

  postfix:
    title: Suffix (KBPostfix)
    description: |
      Text after pass data.
      Default is newline (%0A).
    format: "%0A = Newline (Enter)"
    example: "%0A"
    tip: |
      The newline simulates pressing the Enter key
      after each pass read.

  delay_ms:
    title: Delay (KBDelayMS)
    description: |
      Delay between individual keystrokes in milliseconds.
    format: "5-255 ms"
    example: "5"
    tip: |
      Increase the value if characters are lost.
      Default 5ms works for most systems.
