    to the connected computer. Successful pass reads
    appear in any open text editor.

  log_mode:
    title: Enable Keyboard (KBLogMode)
    description: |
      Enables keyboard emulation.
      When enabled, pass data is sent as keystrokes.
    tip: |
      Useful for simple integrations without software development.
      Works with any program that accepts keyboard input.

  source:
    title: Data Sources (KBSource)
    description: |
      Defines which data types trigger keyboard output.
      Hex string of characters for different pass types.
    format: |
      A = Apple VAS Pass
      G = Google Smart Tap Pass
      0 = MIFARE Card/Tag
      2 = NFC Type 2
      4 = NFC Type 4
      6 = NFC Type 5
      E = Card Emulation
      X = Apple Wallet iPhone
      W = Apple Wallet Watch
    example: "AG (VAS and SmartTap)"
    tip: |
      Combine characters for multiple sources.
      Default is "A5" (VAS + Type 2 + Type 4 + Type 5).

  prefix:
    title: Prefix (KBPrefix)
    description: |
      Optional text before pass data.
      Can contain ASCII-hex (%0A) or variables ($t).
    format: |
      %XX = ASCII-hex (e.g. %0A for newline)
      $t = Timestamp
      $d = Date
      $n = Sequence number
    example: "$t|"
    tip: Leave empty if no prefix is needed.

  postfix:
    title: Suffix (KBPostfix)
    description: |
      Text after pass data.
      Default is newline (%0A).
    format: "%0A = Newline (Enter)"
    example: "%0A"
    tip: |
      The newline simulates pressing the Enter key
      after each pass read.

  delay_ms:
    title: Delay (KBDelayMS)
    description: |
      Delay between individual keystrokes in milliseconds.
    format: "5-255 ms"
    example: "5"
    tip: |
      Increase the value if characters are lost.
      Default 5ms works for most systems.
