  title: MIFARE DESFire
  description: |
    DESFire cards are contactless smart cards with encrypted
    communication. Up to 9 different applications can be
    configured simultaneously.

fields:
  app_id:
    title: Application ID (DESFireAppID)
    description: |
      The DESFire Application ID identifies the application
      on the card. This is a 3-byte hex value.
    format: "6 hex characters (3 bytes)"
    example: "AABBCC, F00001"
    tip: |
      The Application ID is set by the card issuer.
      Check the card documentation for the correct ID.

  file_id:
    title: File ID (DESFireFileID)
    description: |
      The ID of the file within the application to be read.
    format: "1-255"
    example: "1"
    tip: Leave empty for default file.

  key_num:
    title: Key Number (DESFireKeyNum)
    description: |
      The key number for authentication.
      DESFire apps can have up to 14 keys.
    format: "0-14"
    example: "0"
    tip: |
      Key 0 is often the master key.
      Leave empty if no authentication is required.

  key_slot:
    title: Key Slot (DESFireKeySlot)
    description: |
      The slot in the VTAP100 where the authentication key
      is stored.
    format: "1-9"
    tip: |
      Keys must be loaded to the device first via
      VTAP100 configuration.

  crypto:
    title: Encryption (DESFireCrypto)
    description: |
      The cryptographic mode for card communication.
    format: |
      None = No encryption
      3DES = Triple-DES (112-bit)
      AES = AES-128
    tip: |
      AES is more secure and faster than 3DES.
      The mode must match the card configuration.

  format:
    title: Data Format (DESFireFormat)
    description: |
      The output format for read data.
    format: |
      Raw = Raw data (Hex)
      KEY-ID v1 = KEY-ID Format Version 1
      KEY-ID v2 = KEY-ID Format Version 2
    tip: Choose the format matching your receiving software.

  read_length:
    title: Read Length (DESFireReadLength)
    description: |
      Number of bytes to read from the file.
    format: "1-255 bytes"
    example: "3 (default)"
    tip: |
      Read only the required amount of data to
      minimize communication time.

  read_offset:
    title: Read Offset (DESFireReadOffset)
    description: |
      Starting position within the file to read from.
    format: "0-255 bytes"
    example: "0 (default = file start)"
    tip: Use to skip header data.

  diversification:
    title: Key Diversification (DESFireDiversification)
    description: |
      Enables key diversification based on
      the card UID.
    tip: |
      With diversification, the master key is combined
      with the card UID to create a card-specific key.
