  title: NFC Tag Configuration
  description: |
    Configuration for reading NFC tags.
    Supports Type 2, Type 4 and Type 5 tags.

fields:
  type2:
    title: NFC Type 2 (NFCType2)
    description: |
      Read mode for NFC Type 2 tags.
      Supports NTAG and MIFARE Ultralight tags.
    format: |
      0 = Disabled
      U = Read UID
      N = Read NDEF
      B = Read block data
    tip: UID is the fastest mode for simple identification.

  type4:
    title: NFC Type 4 (NFCType4)
    description: |
      Read mode for NFC Type 4 tags.
      Supports DESFire and ISO 14443-4 compatible tags.
    format: |
      0 = Disabled
      U = Read UID
      N = Read NDEF
      B = Read block data
      D = DESFire mode
    tip: |
      DESFire mode enables encrypted access
      to DESFire applications.

  type5:
    title: NFC Type 5 (NFCType5)
    description: |
      Read mode for NFC Type 5 tags.
      Supports ICODE and ISO 15693 tags.
    format: |
      0 = Disabled
      U = Read UID
      N = Read NDEF
      B = Read block data
    tip: Type 5 tags have longer range than other types.

  report_read_error:
    title: Report Errors (NFCReportReadError)
    description: |
      Send error payload on read errors.
      Useful for debugging and error analysis.
    tip: Leave disabled in normal operation.

  ignore_random_uid:
    title: Ignore Random UIDs (IgnoreRandomUID)
    description: |
      Filter randomly generated Type 4 UIDs.
      Some smartphones generate random UIDs.
    tip: Enable if only real tag UIDs should be detected.

  byte_order_reversed:
    title: Reverse Byte Order (TagByteOrder)
    description: |
      Reverses the byte order in output.
      Sometimes needed for compatibility with other systems.
    tip: Default is disabled (normal order).
